## Descriptions

Real-time Fire Detection system that we implemented works on the basis of sensing values from different nodes like smoke detection node ,flame detection node and IR detection node , these values are monitored periodically and any variation from threshold value will activate the corresponding actuation(buzzer, sprinkler, cooler, led blinking) to maintain the condition stable and for indicating purpose .
